## AppImage Qt Cross-Compilation Example

This repository is an attempt to cross-compile a basic Qt application to ARM and package it as an ARM AppImage, using Debian's `arm-linux-gnueabi` cross-compilation toolchain and `armel` packages.

It is currently impossible to cross-compile an AppImage as both AppImageKit and linuxdeployqt projects support creating an AppImage package only for the host system's archtecture, they lack the support of targeting other architectures.

I believe that being able to create an AppImage for X architecture while running Y architecture (cross-compile) is a very important feature to have, as without it you have to resort to creating an AppImage for architecture X by emulating a machine running X architecture in qemu, which has many drawbacks. Using qemu to emulate a different architecture is slow, all the operations and the build process inside the qemu vm take an order of magnitude longer to complete in comparison to when cross-compiling on the host system without any emulation. Also, having to use qemu to create an AppImage package for a different architecture is too complicated for something that is supposed to make packaging easier, which is what AppImage tries to achieve. These issues of slowness and complexity caused by the lack of a cross-compilation support become even more prominent for developers wanting to pubish their software on GitHub by building it on Travis-CI: while you can run qemu on Travis-CI, qemu on Travis is so slow that even emulating the host's x86_64 architecture and bulding a Hello World app inside of it can easily make your build exceed Travis'es 50 minute time limit (there is no kvm acceleration available on Travis), and the complexity of writing a script which would automate creation of a qemu vm out of a distribution's ISO and then somehow login inside the vm and run the build process in there, receiving and reacting on all of the results of the commands being ran in the vm, is bit too much than most developers would want to deal with.

This repository is to serve AppImageKit and linuxdeployqt projects as a cross-compilation example, so that they could fork it, modify it, modify their own software, and see if they can get the cross-compilation of AppImage working.
